# Painter
##A painter on canvas using JS/jQuery------------------------------------------------------------------


##Tips

- Double-click a color to set it as a background. Be careful, it will erase your current drawing !
- Set the color on black when drawing stars so the magin happens !
- When using the *#* tool, the links are only created with current-click stroke. Think about stopping the stroke here and there.
- Set a white background before drawing something, otherwise the background will be transparent
